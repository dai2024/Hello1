# Hello1

There are no inherent risks in this program itself, but there are several issues with the Makefile. Specifically, the clean target can potentially delete other files accidentally because it uses the rm command to forcibly delete files. Therefore, it is necessary to explicitly specify the files to be deleted in the Makefile.

Moreover, the variable names used in the Makefile (CC, CFLAGS, OBJS, TARGET) do not follow appropriate naming conventions. For example, since OBJS is plural, it appears as though there are multiple object files, but in reality only a single object file is specified.

As a result, while there are no immediate risks associated with this program, there are potential issues with the Makefile. To make the program more robust, the Makefile should be properly modified.

```
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-O0 -Wall
TARGET=Hello1
OBJS=main.o

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS)

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(TARGET)

.PHONY: clean
```

In the modified Makefile, the OBJS variable now only specifies main.o. Additionally, in the clean target, the files to be deleted are now explicitly specified, thus avoiding the risk of accidentally deleting other files with the rm command. Furthermore, a .PHONY rule has been added to allow clean to be executed even if a file named clean exists.
