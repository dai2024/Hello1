## tutorials
To create a tutorial for C17, the first program to write is traditionally one that displays "Hello, World!" The example program includes the header file "stdio.h", which defines functions for handling standard input and output. Inside the main() function, the printf() function is used to output the string "Hello, World!" with a newline character (\n). Compiling and running the program will display the "Hello, World!" string on the console.
