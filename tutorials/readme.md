To create a tutorial for C17, the first program to write is traditionally one that displays "Hello, World!" The example program includes the header file "stdio.h", which defines functions for handling standard input and output. Inside the main() function, the printf() function is used to output the string "Hello, World!" with a newline character (\n). Compiling and running the program will display the "Hello, World!" string on the console.

This program adds two integer values and displays the result. First, two integer variables num1 and num2 are defined and assigned the values 10 and 20, respectively. Then, a variable sum is defined and assigned the sum of num1 and num2. Finally, the printf function is used to display the result.

In the printf function, %d represents an integer value. The values of num1, num2, and sum are displayed in the order they appear in the function arguments.

Use the above example as a reference and try creating the next level of the program!
